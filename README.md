# View Yearly Education Funding by State

## Viewing the dataset
The easiest way to view the dataset is using Python to start a server with the following command:

```python -m http.server 8080```

and then navigating to ```localhost:8080```


## Contents of the dataset
The page consists of four different visualizations:
* tile map
* stacked bar chart
* timeline
* over/under chart

The over/under chart uses a brush tool that can select the different lines representing individual states
